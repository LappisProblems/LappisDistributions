# LappisDistributions

This repository contains useful functions for some selected probability distributions. This is purely made for my own enjoyment, but feel free to use it!
So far I have included PDF/PMFs, CDFs, means, variances, medians, modes, skewness and kurtosis.

Considering adding random number generators for the distributions.

Install using; pip install "git+https://github.com/LappisProblems/LappisDistributions.git#egg=LappisDistributions"

The following distributions are currently available;
- PERT
